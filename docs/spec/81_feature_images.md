# Oksskolten Spec — Image Archive

> [Back to Overview](./01_overview.md)

## Overview

A feature that downloads images in article Markdown (`![alt](url)`), saves them locally or uploads them to a remote host, and rewrites the URLs. This protects against broken links when the original images become unavailable.

## Motivation

Hotlinked images become inaccessible when the original article is deleted or the hosting service goes down. For articles worth keeping long-term, archiving images locally (or to a remote host) ensures the reading experience is preserved indefinitely.

## Design

### Enabling

Enable by setting `images.enabled` to `'1'` or `'true'` in the settings table. This can be toggled from the settings page (`/settings/ai`).

### Processing Flow (`archiveArticleImages()`)

```
POST /api/articles/:id/archive-images
    │
    ├─ Precondition checks: article exists / full_text present / feature enabled / not yet archived
    ├─ Return 202 Accepted immediately
    │
    └─ Background processing:
        │
        ├─ Extract image URLs from Markdown via regex: /!\[([^\]]*)\]\(([^)]+)\)/g
        │
        ├─ Skip the following:
        │   - Already local URLs (/api/articles/images/...)
        │   - data: URIs
        │
        ├─ Download images with safeFetch() (30-second timeout)
        │   - If Content-Length or actual buffer size exceeds max_size_mb → skip
        │
        ├─ Filename: {articleId}_{sha256(url).slice(0,12)}{ext}
        │
        ├─ Local mode:
        │   - Save to images.storage_path (default: data/articles/images/)
        │   - Rewrite URL to /api/articles/images/{filename}
        │
        ├─ Remote mode:
        │   - POST FormData to images.upload_url
        │   - Extract URL from response using images.upload_resp_path
        │   - On failure, keep the original URL (partial success is acceptable)
        │
        ├─ UPDATE full_text with the rewritten text
        └─ Record timestamp via markImagesArchived(articleId)
```

### Storage Path Confinement

`images.storage_path` is settable over the API and is joined with a
request-supplied filename when serving images, so an unconstrained value would
expose arbitrary host files. Allowed roots:

- `DATA_DIR` (always)
- `IMAGES_STORAGE_ROOT`, when the operator sets that environment variable — for
  putting images on a separate volume

A relative value is resolved against `DATA_DIR`. A path outside every allowed
root is rejected with `400` on write, and ignored on read (the endpoint returns
`404` and archiving is skipped) so a value stored before this validation existed
cannot be used. Note the asymmetry that makes this a boundary: the env var is
operator-controlled, the setting is settable by any write-scoped API token.

### Image Serving

Images archived in local mode are served via `GET /api/articles/images/:filename`.

- Path traversal protection: `path.basename(filename) !== filename || filename.includes('..')` → 400
- MIME type: based on file extension (`.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.png`, `.gif`, `.webp`, `.svg`, `.avif`)
- Cache: `Cache-Control: public, max-age=31536000, immutable`

### Image Deletion

When an article is deleted, if `images_archived_at` is set, `deleteArticleImages(articleId)` is called. All files matching `{articleId}_*` in the local images directory are deleted.

### Remote Upload Settings

Settings for uploading to an arbitrary image hosting service:

| Setting | Description | Example |
|---|---|---|
| `mode` | Set to `'remote'` | `remote` |
| `url` | Upload endpoint | `https://imghost.example.com/api/upload` |
| `headers` | HTTP headers (JSON string) | `{"Authorization":"Bearer xxx"}` |
| `fieldName` | Form field name | `image` |
| `respPath` | Dot-path to extract URL from response | `data.url` |

`extractByDotPath(obj, dotPath)` traverses the nested path in the response JSON to retrieve the URL. If the configuration is incomplete (`upload_url` or `upload_resp_path` not set), processing is skipped.

A test upload (`POST /api/settings/image-storage/test`) sends a 1x1 transparent PNG to verify that the settings are configured correctly.
